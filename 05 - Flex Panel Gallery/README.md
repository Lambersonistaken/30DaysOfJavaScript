# JavaScript and CSS Exercise Flex Panels by Lamberson

This is a project from Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 course. The goal of this project is to create a panel that expands when clicked. The panel expands to show a picture and some text. The panel also has a transition effect when it expands and collapses.
